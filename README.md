## Help save the Belgian people from unwanted phone calls

### How to install

Requires Python >3.9 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Clone this script in a directory (e.g. `do-not-call`) and cd to it.

    cd do-not-call
    poetry install

    python main.py

### How it works

The script will ask you

    Which area codes do you want to cover?
    "E.g. 050 or 02,03,0474 [leave empty to do all area_codes]: 

You can enter nothing (to cover all area codes, including mobile phones), a single area code or a number of area codes (separated with a comma).

    Start at [leave empty to start at 0]: 
    End at [leave empty to end at highest possible]:

(Highest possible is 99 99 99 for three-digit area codes (e.g. 0474) and 999 99 99 for two-digit area codes (e.g. 02).

    Do you really want to do this? [y/N]

If you choose "y", a new user will be created at dncm.be and the script will add the autogenerated numbers to the do-not-call list. (If you don't choose "y", a list of what number would have been added is shown.)
